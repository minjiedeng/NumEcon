# NumEcon

This is the GitHub repository for the course **Introduction to programming and numerical analysis**. In addition to the files for the course itself, this repository also contains code examples for various other economics courses taught at University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics. For example, the folder "course_micro1" contains examples from an intermediate level microeconomics course.

# Course Description

This course introduces you to programming and enables you to perform basic data analysis and numerically solve simple economic models. This will e.g. allow you to both visualize solutions, easily test assumptions with respect to functional forms and parameters, and consider more realistic models, which can be solved numerically, but not algebraically.  

*The course requires absolutely no prior experience with programming.*

The first part of the course introduces you to programming using the general purpose Python language. First you will learn to write conditional statements, loops and functions, and to print and plot results. Next, you will learn to test, debug and document your code, and use online communities proactively when writing code. 

The second part of the course give you a brief introduction to importing data from offline and online sources, and producing central descriptive statistics. 

The third part of the course introduce you to the concept of a numerical algorithm. This includes solving linear algebra problems, solving non-linear equations, finding fixed points, and solving numerical optimization problems. You will also learn to simulate stochastic models using (pseudo) random number generators.

The fourth and final part of the course allow you to get hands-on experience with applying the above techniques to solve well-known problems from the core bachelor courses. Specifically, you will work both with a small data analysis project, and a larger model analysis project based on a well-known economic model.

While the course only focus on programming in Python, you will also be equipped to start learning other programming languages (such as MATLAB, R, Julia or C/C++) on your own.
